# A Project to learn HTML and CSS

This is my solution to the first project of the OpenClassroom's web developer course (https://openclassrooms.com/fr/). 
This project introduce the basics of HTLM and CSS through the integration of a very specific design they provide.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Edit the text in the seach bar. The input need to be in a form and the search function musn't work.
- Click on the whole activities and host cards (not just the title). The links are empty and need to be fill with an #.
- See an hover effect on the search filters. The filter must not work.
- Click on "Hébergements" and "Activities", they need to lead to the host section and the activites section.

You need to : 
- Use 992px as a breakpoint for desktop and 768px for the mobile one.
- Create desktop first, then tablet and mobile at the end.
- Choose the best resolution for your image
- Use flexbox, grid is forbidden
- Use HTML and CSS only, frameworks, bootstrap... are forbidden.
- Check compatibility on every browser
